    <h1>Terms of Service – Kontent_69</h1>
    <p>
    By using Kontent_69, you agree to the following terms:<br><br>
    Kontent_69 is a content automation tool that enables users to upload, schedule, and publish videos to TikTok through official integration with the TikTok Content Posting API. The tool operates via the Make (Integromat) automation platform, which sends authorized HTTP requests on behalf of the authenticated user.<br><br>
    Users must authenticate their TikTok account through OAuth 2.0, using TikTok's secure authorization process. Kontent_69 does not store or access users’ login credentials, tokens, or private data. All data flows directly between TikTok and the user's Make scenario.<br><br>
    Kontent_69 does not guarantee content visibility, engagement, or successful publication. The visibility of posted content is subject to TikTok platform policies, user account permissions, and API limitations (e.g., non-reviewed apps can only post in SELF_ONLY mode).<br><br>
    The user remains fully responsible for the content being uploaded, including its legality, ownership, and compliance with TikTok’s Community Guidelines and Terms of Service.<br><br>
    Kontent_69 is not affiliated with or endorsed by TikTok Inc. Use of the TikTok name and API is solely for the purpose of enabling functionality permitted under the TikTok Developer Program.<br><br>
    These terms may be updated without notice. Continued use of the tool indicates your agreement with the most current version.
